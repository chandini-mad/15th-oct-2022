	<p>Varun, a military doctor working in the Indian Army Medical Corps is a strict and practical person. While returning home from an operation, he receives a voicemail from his fiancée, Padmini, who urges him to call off their upcoming wedding. While enquiring about her sudden change-of-decision with her family. Padmini belittles him for being emotionally distant and apathetic. While leaving, Varun and Padmini's family learns that Chinnu has gone missing. The family lodges a complaint with the police – which in turn appoints Bhagat, a low-ranking police officer, to monitor the family's communications.Varun, a military doctor working in the Indian Army Medical Corps is a strict and practical person.
